<h2>Our Mission Statement</h2>
<p>First off, thanks for checking out our pool, we hope you enjoy your stay. Our main goal is to help people to "mine" cryptocurrency. We manage and update this mining pool, and plan to make it the best pool you've ever joined! We also offer mining rig contracts to build rigs in our remote locations, that also join into this pool. So that means with all of us working together we can do so much more!</p>

<h2>Yiimp</h2>
<p>The most important thing we are focused on here at LinPool is keeping those who join our pool happy! We want to add as many coins as possible for the best mining abilities. We keep our dataservers in an undisclosed remote location, outside of our mining rig locations. Some of our future plans for linpool include associated mining calculators, cloud mining, and of course some theme updates, lol. The base of this site is using YIIMP which is an open source project, check it out <a href="http://github.com/tpruvot/yiimp" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<h2>Mining Contracts</h2>
<p>Mining rigs are great! We offer services to our clients to build and maintain their rigs. We build and keep the rigs that we build in a clean, and remote location. For maintenance we charge a 15% fee that covers power, overclocking GPU's, and maintaining all your rigs on top notch software. If you're interested in these services please take a look at our <a href="/site/linminingc" target="_blank">PDF contract</a>.</p>
